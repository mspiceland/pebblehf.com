            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>Amateur radio is a fantastic hobby for learning, connection, and adventure. Many people get into amateur radio with inexpensive voice radios and a tech license. Now anyone looking to explore the wonderful world of HF radio will now have an ultra-affordable option. Now upgrade to your general license and start having fun!</p>
            <p>Small and portable radios are perfect for learning HF radio, connecting with people, and outdoor radio adventures. They allow you to have fun with the expanding world of Parks on the Air and Summits on the Air. Pebble HF is an ultra-affordable, ultra-portable HF radio kit for anyone to get into HF amateur radio, to open up those possibilities.</p>
            <p>Pebble HF was born out of passion from HamRadioDuo as a way to give back. Mike, N4FFF, may not have gotten into the hobby without originaly thinking that a tiny $10 kit was all he needed.  It turns out, he was never able to make a contact on it, but he was hooked.  Now we want to make sure that a great option exists for anyone wanting to get started.  Mike N4FFF and Becky N4BKY have now met many people who want to get started, but are not ready to jump into the deep end.  They are not yet sure how much money or time they want to commit to try morse code or outdoor radio or HF radio in general.  After you learn and realize it is for you, your budget may increase.  There are many fantastic QPR radios already (<a href="https://www.qrplabs.com/">QMX</a> and <a href="https://www.cft1radio.com/">CFT1</a> are great examples). If you are already interested in one of those, please get one! Pebble HF was created for all of those people who need an ultra low cost option with minimal effort to build as a kit.</p>
