            <h2>What makes Pebble HF different?</h2>
            <ul class="key-points">
                <li>Ultra-affordable under $50 and easy to build</li>
                <li> ~ 5W output with 12V input</li>
                <li> ~ 1W output powered by USB-C 5V</li>
                <li>Built in CW key and microphone</li>

                    <p>From the begining, every decision was made to keep the cost low and easy to build.  Pebble HF was born from the idea of how to make a capable QRP radio ultra-affordable and easy to build. For that reason, it is a single band, minimal parts, uses as many surface mount parts fully populated, and is kit-friendly.  It uses an existing and well proven design, the uSDX, which suites these goals.</p>
                    <p>Pebble HF is a QRP all-mode capable radio for a single band. Pebble HF is a low power QRP radio that can output ~5W on battery power but can also output ~1W powered by USB, so that you can get started even without investing a special battery yet. Weighing less than 0.5 lbs (8oz), it is a great option for trying out portable radio.</p>
                    <p>Pebble HF is an open source design based on the classic uSDX. Hardware design by Barb WB2CBA and firmware by Guido PE1NNZ and modified by Mike N4FFF.</p>
                    <p class="note">* digital modes requires an external adapter.</p>

            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>Pebble HF was born out of passion from HamRadioDuo, in collaboration with Barb wb2cba, as a way to give back. Mike, N4FFF, may not have gotten into the hobby without originaly thinking that a tiny $10 kit was all he needed. It turns out, he was never able to make a contact on it, but he was hooked. Now we want to make sure that a great option exists for anyone wanting to get started. Mike N4FFF and Becky N4BKY have now met many people who want to get started, but are not ready to jump into the deep end. They are not yet sure how much money or time they want to commit to try morse code or outdoor radio or HF radio in general. After you learn and realize it is for you, your budget may increase. There are many fantastic QPR radios already (<a href="https://www.qrplabs.com/">QMX</a> and <a href="https://www.cft1radio.com/">CFT1</a> are great examples). If you are already interested in one of those, please get one! Pebble HF was created for all of those people who need an ultra low cost option with minimal effort to build as a kit.</p>
