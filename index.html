            <h2>What makes Pebble HF different?</h2>
            <ul class="key-points">
                <li>Ultra-affordable, easy to build kit</li> 
                <li> ~ 5W output with 12V input</li>
                <li> ~ 1W output powered by USB-C 5V</li>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Pebble HF was born from the idea of how to make a capable QRP radio ultra-affordable and easy to build. It is ultra-affordable by being a single band radio with minimal parts and almost all pre-populated surface mount parts, which makes it easy to build.  It uses an existing and well proven design, the uSDX, which suites these goals. **</p>
                    <p>Pebble HF is a low power QRP radio for morse code (CW), voice, and digital modes*.  Pebble HF can output ~5W on battery power but can also output ~1W powered by USB, so that you can get started even without investing a special battery yet. Weighing less than 0.5 lbs (8oz), it is a great option for trying out portable radio.</p>
                    <p class="note">* digital modes requires an external adapter.</p>
                    <p class="note">** Pebble HF is an open source design based on the classic uSDX. Hardware design by Barb WB2CBA and firmware by Guido PE1NNZ and modified by Mike N4FFF.</p>

            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>Pebble HF was born out of passion from HamRadioDuo, in collaboration with Barb wb2cba, as a way to give back. The backbone of Pebble HF is from Barb wb2cba's hardware design and an existing firmware design by Guido PE1NNZ. Thank you so much to both of them!</p>
            <p>This project is a day dream that Mike, N4FFF, has had since before becoming a ham.  He got started in amateur radio with the believe that a cheap kit radio called the PIXIE is all he needed.  He never was able to make a single contact on the PIXIE, but it was it's existance that allowed him to get started.  The PIXIE's lack of filterning and tuning ended up being a problem he couldn't get past. Now we are on a mission to make sure that a great option exists for anyone needting to get started!
            <p>Mike was introduced to Barb wb2cba by a viewer who was using his TinyDX QRPp radio for digital use. After a decade of actively looking for someone with the right experience, Barb's existing uSDX design was a perfect baseline. He modiied the design to make it ultra-affordable by making it a single band and, importantly, making as much of the design as possible surface mount so that it can be ordered super low cost.  It is a brilliant design for this purpose because the base open source project is a software defined radio making it possible to pack a ton into a tiny package with super low cost!</p>
            <p> There are many fantastic QPR radios already (<a href="https://www.qrplabs.com/">QMX</a> and <a href="https://www.cft1radio.com/">CFT1</a> are great examples). If you are already interested in one of those, please get one! Pebble HF was created for all of those people who need an ultra low cost option with minimal effort to build as a kit.</p>
